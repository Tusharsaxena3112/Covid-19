The Covid-19 epidemic is spreading all over the world now. In late December 2019, a cluster of unexplained pneumonia cases has been reported in china. A few days later, the causative agent of this mysterious pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus. This causative virus has been temporarily named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and the relevant infected disease has been named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) by the World Health Organisation.

The purpose of this covid-19 web tracker is that it helps in very effective way to understand the complexity of the situation. Therefore, in absence of pharmaceutical interventions, the implementation of precautions, hygienic measures will be essential to control and to minimise human transmission of the virus.
